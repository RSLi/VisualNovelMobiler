# sh_enc_utility
Here were two bash scripts that I wrote a long time ago just to help me encrypt files before backing up when necessary.
These scripts don't filter the input and might damage your data if not used properly. Use on your own discretion.

How to encrypt:
1. Copy the loge.sh into the same directory of the file that you want to encrypt
2. Execute loge.sh
3. Follow the directions in the terminal correctly
4. Note that the original file will not be deleted

How to decrypt:
1. Copy the logd.sh into the same directory of the file that you want to decrypt
2. Execute logd.sh
3. Follow the directions in the termial correctly
